# Initial Recon

## Visual Inspection

Inspected exterior of the router, and noted label on the back that contained FCC ID for further review. 

FCC ID: 2AXJ4WR841NV14

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/router_ffc_id.jpg)

Opened router case by removing two Phillips screws and applying pressure between pressure-fit parts with a spudger tool.

Noted three chips of interest on the PCB for further inspection (shown as details A, B, and C in the picture below)

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/router_areas_of_interest.jpg)

## On-board testing

Noted the presence of a test connection that appears to be a UART connection based on the 4 pins labelled with VCC, GND, RX and TX (shown as detail D above)

Verified operating voltage of the PCB is 9V by testing the voltage drop across the input jack with a multimeter. 

Identified ground connection on P1 (detail E above) by testing continuity with the ground connection on the input jack.

Tested the suspected UART connection with a multimeter to verify pins matched the silk screen labels, each was pin tested as follows:

- VCC: Measured voltage drop between VCC and ground as 3.3V confirming operating voltage of UART at 3.3V
- GND: Checked for continuity between GND pin on UART and known ground on board and confirmed GND is in fact a ground. 
- RX: Measured voltage drop between RX and ground as 0V, test to ensure it was not connected to ground by checking continuity between RX and known ground connections, no continuity found
- TX: Measured Voltage drop between RX and ground as ~3.3V during standard operation. 

After confirming pinout, based on the observations of the pins this appears to be a UART connection, checked for transmission on the TX pin during boot up by power cycling router and measuring voltage drop. Noted fluctuation on TX pin from ~1V - 3V suggests busy and active transmission during bootup.

Soldered through hole inline header pins to suspected UART connection to facilitate further testing with a logic analyzer and later on USB to Serial Adapter. 

Attached Logic Analyzer to TX and GND pins of UART connection and captured a transmission during boot up, a screenshot of single transmission frame shown below. 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Uart_Capture_Single_Frame.png)

Manual framing of the signal confirmed a UART transmission, noted the start bit, 8 data bits, one stop bit and no parity bit. 

Measured the baud rate as 125,000 however based on standard serial baud rates suspect that it is actually 115,200. 

Based on these findings applied a UART decoder to the channel with the below settings. 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uart_decoder_settings.png)

Decoded UART signal confirmed UART parameters and showed the presence of a boot loader and boot-up logs to be investigated further.

## OSINT and Online Recon

Used previously located FCC ID to find FCC Equipment Authorization filing for the router (https://fccid.io/2AXJ4WR841NV14)

Noted in the filing that the ID had been changed from the previous TE7WR841NV14. 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ffc_id_change_request.png)

Inspecting the previous filing (https://fccid.io/TE7WR841NV14) internal photos of the router were located. Unfortunately, schematics, functional descriptions and block diagrams were redacted as confidential. 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fcc-id-1.png)

Detailed pictures of two chips of interest were shown that detailed the chip manufacturer and part number. 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ffc-id-mediatek.png)

Previously denoted chip A Id'd as MEDIATEK MT7628NN

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fcc-id-zentel.png)

Previously denoted chip B Id'd as Zentel A3S56D40GTP -50L

Unfortunately, the markers on chip C were not readable in the FCC pictures. Returning to the test router, high-resolution pictures were taken and blown up to Id chip. 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cfeon_chip_id.jpg)

Chip C was Id'd as cFeon QH32B-104HIP.

Data sheets were located online for each of the chips. 

**MEDIATEK MT7628NN:** System On Chip (SOC) containing CPU. Important details included that this is a purpose-built SOC for N300 routers. The CPU is MIPS24KEc, which supports Linux 2.6.36 SDK and Linux 3.10 SDK. Interfaces with flash memory via SPI.

Data Sheet: https://files.seeedstudio.com/products/114992470/MT7628_datasheet.pdf

**Zentel A3S56D40GTP -50L:** DRAM 32Kb

Data Sheet: https://www.mouser.ca/datasheet/2/1130/DSA3S56D340GTPF_02-1984099.pdf

**cFeon QH32B-104HIP:** Id'd as full part number EN25Q32B-104HIP. Noted as Flash ROM that communicates via SPI. 

Data Sheet: https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/675622/EON/EN25QH32A.html

Searching for the firmware found it supplied through the official support page for the router.

## Initial Network Recon

Connected test computer to the network hosed by the router. Router IP address id'd as 192.168.0.1.

Nmap scans were performed for both TCP and UDP. 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nmap_tcp_scan.png)

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nmap_tcp_scan_2.png)

TCP scans revealed 3 open ports:

Port 22 - ssh running Dropbear sshd 2012.55

Port 80 - http hosting the routers configuration web portal

Port 1900 - UPnP (Portable SDK for UPnP devices 1.6.19 (Linux 2.6.36))

Notable detail confirmed the suspicion that the router is running Linux kernel 2.6.36. 

UDP scans revealed 2 open ports: 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nmap_udp_scan.png)

Port 67/udp - dhcps

Port 1900/udp - UPnP

## Scouting Previously Disclosed CVEs

Scouted for previously disclosed and patched CVEs and multiple. Noted a common theme of a lack of proper user input validation on forms and inputs in the web portal that led to either buffer overflow or command injection of an underlying function or service being called.

Connected USB to UART adapter to the previously located UART pins based on the below pinout:

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/UART+to+USB+pinout.jpg)

Opened Terminal Session via Screen with the previously identified baud rate.

After powering on the router the bootloader logging and Linux initialization logging from init and init scripts were displayed over the serial console session:

**Command**: `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`

Some key information of note from the boot logs were:

**Bootloader:** 

Appears to be a repurposed build of open source version `U-Boot 1.1.3 (Feb  3 2021 - 10:10:08)`, denoted as `Ralink UBoot Version: 4.3.0.0`

Bootloader default selected `3: System Boot system code via Flash.(0xbc010000)` as the boot option, may be able to interrupt boot process and select another boot option

**Linux Initilization**:

Version: `Linux version 2.6.36 (jenkins@mobile-System) (gcc version 4.6.3 (Buildroot 2012.11.1) ) #1 Wed Feb 3 10:13:07 CST 2021`

CPU Information:  `CPU revision is: 00019655 (MIPS 24Kc)`

Dropbear: 

Multiple details about Dropbear initialization including the below line also reveal what is most likely a writeable filepath. 

`[ util_execSystem ] 141:  prepareDropbear cmd is "dropbearkey -t rsa -f /var/tmp/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key"`

## Interupting Bootloader

Through online research, it was discovered that the bootloader interrupt command is "tpl". There is a very small window to interrupt the bootloader so the easiest way to do it is to issue a reboot command and then immediately being typing "tpl" repeatedly. 

```
~ # reboot
The system is going down NOW!
Sent SIGTERM to all processes
Terminated
Sent SIGKILL toRestarting system.
```

Doing so interrupted the bootloader and provided access to the bootloaders Command Line Interface. 

```

switch BootType:
   
4: System Enter Boot Command Line Interface.

U-Boot 1.1.3 (Feb  3 2021 - 10:10:08)
MT7628 # help     
Unknown command 'help' - try 'help'
MT7628 #   

```
Usually this CLI provides access to tools to read and write to memory, set environment details and gather further information about the board. Unfortunately, the repurposed version of U-Boot has removed this functionality. The only functionality remaining is to perform a TFTP boot. This can be done to boot from firmware over the network as a recovery method. 


## Enumeration via UART Shell

Pressing Enter revealed there was shell access with no login as root user:

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/initial_shell_access.png)

Checking over the available binaries in the bin folder, busybox was discovered: 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/busbox_bin_id.png)

Busybox is a popular binary used on embedded systems as it packages many common Linux/Unix binaries into one smaller package. 

Observing the available functions in busybox it was noted that this appears to be a stripped-down version of Busybox, however, TFTP was still available. 

## Transferring Full Version of Busybox over TFTP

The full version of Busybox was downloaded from: https://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/

The TFTP from the existing busybox was then used to transfer over the full version of busybox. 

Command From Kali VM to start TFTP server as daemon: `sudo atftpd --daemon`

Created a folder to transfer over tools in `/var/tmp/_tools` /var was previously identified as writable. 

Command from Router to initiate file transfer: `tftp -r busybox-mipsel -g 192.168.0.100`

The full version of busybox was then available to use for further enumeration. 

## Enumerating /var folder

Using the new full version of Busybox grep was utilized to search for files with "pass" in it in order to identify possible hardcoded passwords. 

Command: `/var/temp/_tools/busybox-mipsel grep -r 'pass' .`

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/grepping_pass.png)

Noted three config files that may contain passwords and what appears to be a hashed password for Dropbear. 

Config file passwords were blank, Dropbear hash was saved to attempt to crack at a later time. 

Command: `/var/temp/_tools/busybox-mipsel grep -r 'pass' .`

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/grep_admin.png)

Command: `/var/temp/_tools/busybox-mipsel find -name '*.xml'`

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/find_xml.png)

Command: `/var/temp/_tools/busybox-mipsel find -name '*.conf'`

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/find_conf.png)

Further enumeration of the config files did not reveal any additional useful information. 

## Cracking Password Hashes

Admin hash from passwd file was identified as Unix Md5 hash and cracked using the below command.

Command on Kali VM: `hashcat -a 0 -m 500 admin.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
 
Admin Password cracked as "1234" 

![iamge](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hash_cat_admin.png)

Dropbear hash form dropbearpasswd file was identified as normal MD5 hash and cracked using the below command.

Command on Kali VM: `hashcat -a 0 -m 0 dropbear.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

Dropbear password was cracked "1234qwer" this was noted to be the password that was created for the admin login of the router via the browser. 

The password file is dynamically created on startup from the router's admin password. 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dropbear_hash.png)

## Checking Running Processes and Network Connections

The busybox binary transferred was used again to check the running processes via ps. 

Command: `/var/temp/_tools/busybox-mipsel ps`

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ps.png)

Noted that all processes were running as the admin user and there was no principle of least privilege being followed. 

The same process was followed to check running processes using netstat.

Command: `/var/temp/_tools/busybox-mipsel netstat` 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/netstat+-+Copy.png)

## Prompting Additional Console Log Messages

Looking through the unprompted console log messages one repeating log message stood out:

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/util_execSystem.png)

A repeated call by `[  util_execSystem  ]` appears to be indicative of a log from a function in a shared object library. 

It also appears to be a system call which is a c function that allows the running of a system command. These can be dangerous in nature for command injection if the function uses user input. 

These console log messages, especially those which allow tracing back to specific functions can allow for easier reverse engineering. To test this the wireless setup of the router was performed using the web portal. 

Wireless Setup
![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wireless_setup.png)

This triggered many console logs that showed the use of the execSystem function for user-supplied inputs.

# Firmware Extraction and Analysis

## Firmware Extraction from onboard ROM

From the previous recon, it was confirmed that the flash ROM on the board (EN25Q32B-104HIP) was using SPI to communicate with the processor, to confirm this a logic analyzer was attached to the pins of the ROM using test clips. 

The initial boot process was captured as this process contains many reads from the processor to the flash ROM. The logic analyzer confirmed the SPI function of the flash ROM matched that of the datasheet. 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/SPI_capture.png)

After confirming the SPI flash functioned as expected a ch341a flash programmer was connected to the flash ROM as per the data sheet pinout in order to read the entire contents of the flash ROM. 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ch341a_programmer_setup.jpg)

The firmware was then extracted from the ROM using flashrom and the following command:

`flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r tp_link_wr841n_ext.bin`

## Firmware Analysis

To confirm the firmware extraction was successful an initial analysis was performed on it using binwalk with the following command:

`binwalk tp_link_wr841n_ext.bin`

The initial analysis by binwalk showed that the extraction appeared to be successful as it was able to pickout three partitions on the firwmare that very closely matched the partition table that was previously observed during bootup. 

![image](https://iot-hw-hacking-resources.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/binwalk_init_analysis.png)

As an additional confirmation, the entropy of the file was analyzed using binwalk. 

`binwalk -E tp_link_wr841n_ext.bin`

The entropy confirmed the layout of the firmware matched what was expected on the ROM. The first partition was clearly the unencrypted/uncompressed bootloader as the entropy was floating around 0.5. 

The second partition matched the starting address location and length of the kernel. The entropy being around a solid 1 confirms that it is LZMA compressed as was shown by binwalk.

The third partition also matched the starting address location and length of the root file system, in addition the entropy shows that it is in fact compressed as well. 

An additional partition or section of data is visible in the entropy analysis that binwalk was not able to identify previously, this most likely indicates an encrypted section.

Binwalk was then used to automatically extract the contents of the firmware. 

`binwalk -e tp_link_wr841n_ext.bin`

The automatic extraction by binwalk was able to carve out the LZMA compressed kernel and squashfs filesystem and then automatically decompress both of the files. 

As binwalk was not able to automatically extract the bootloader it was extracted manually using dd. 

`dd if=tp_link_ext.bin bs=1 skip=53536 count=12512 of=u_boot.bin`

After extracting the root file system the contents of it were enumerated which revealed multiple binaries and shared object files that may be of interest to reverse engineer. In addition, two config files called  *default_config.xml* and  *reduced_data_model.xml* were located however these config files appear to be encrypted. 

Strings was then used to identify any binaries or shared object files that had the above xml file names as strings in them to identify which files to reverse engineer in an attempt to decrypt them. 

`strings -f * | grep ".xml"

This revealed that the libcmm.so shared object file had both the xml file names as strings in it.
